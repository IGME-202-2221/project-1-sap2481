### Student Info

-   Name: Sam Peterson
-   Section: 05

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: Side (I want to do topdown, but I still need to figure out how to fix camera orientation in Unity WebGL)
-   Camera Movement: No Camera Movement
-   Player Health: Healthbar
-   End Condition: The game ends when the player runs out of health or defeats the Dreadnought by bringing its health to 0.
-   Scoring: Scoring is determined by how much damage you deal to the Dreadnought before the player runs out of health & how much time it took.

### Game Description

Dreadnought: A shoot-em-up game against one singular enemy vessel: the Dreadnought, an ultra-powerful ship that must be defeated by your smaller and weaker fighter.

    -   Left: A / Left Arrow
    -   Right: D / Right Arrow

## You Additions

This game is different for me in that it will have only one enemy with multiple weapon types to use against the player, with weapon recharges & time-in-effect differing depending on the weapon's power.
